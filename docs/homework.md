## Exercises

During the course you will work on the following excercises

1. A first look at seismic data.

1. NMO correction and velocity analysis

1. Wavefield extrapolation and migration.

1. Fourier, Radon and filtering.
 
1. From processing to inversion I.

1. From processing to inversion II.

1. Introduction to Compressive Sensing

1. Full Waveform inversion

These exercises will introduce you to the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org), [Devito](https://www.devitoproject.org)-a Domain-specific Language (DSL) for automatic code generation for highly optimized finite differences, and [Judi](https://github.com/slimgroup/JUDI.jl)-a framework for large-scale seismic modeling and inversion and designed to enable rapid translations of algorithms to fast and efficient code that scales to industry-size problems.

### Hand in

Please turn in your assignments as pdf files. The assignments should be send to [Felix J. Herrmann](mailto:felix.herrmann@gatech.edu). Late hand ins are not accepted.

Unless stated otherwise the labs are due one week after the lab. 

### Feedback

We will give you feedback on the marking of the exercises.
